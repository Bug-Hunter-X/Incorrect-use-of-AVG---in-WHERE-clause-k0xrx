This example demonstrates a common error in SQL queries involving the use of aggregate functions like AVG() in the WHERE clause.  The query attempts to filter employees in the 'Sales' department whose salary is greater than the average salary, but this will result in an error because the AVG() function cannot be directly used in a WHERE clause like this.  The solution provided shows the correct way to achieve the desired result using a subquery.
